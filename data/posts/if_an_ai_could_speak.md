## Where we are

Like everyone else I've been thinking a lot about AI, LLMs, and the like. I've always been fascinated with the idea that if AGI comes 
how will we really tell and when do they become an animal equal? This isn't a new 21st Centurary thought. The 1920 play _R.U.R._ shows when a 
robot reaches AGI, where's the difference between human soul and freedom, and a robot's? Extending that thought further it really comes down
to Plato and souls, and Wittgenstein's idea of the unsayable.

I'll posit two _beliefs_:
    * **To believe AGI is possible is to deny the existence of free will.**
    * **If an AI could speak we would not understand it.**  

What's incredible and factual in this moment is an LLM's ability to appear life like with just statistics and communicating with words. We don't really
think of language on a daily level being a powerful system, but that's exactly what it is. And just by modeling language in an LLM we have a chat bot that
is creative and intelligent. It's able to respond within the context of the conversation.

If you didn't have language would you still have consciousness?

Is Chat GPT more intelligent than a fly? Is it more conscious?

If a Chat GPT model of a dog's consciousness be created what would it be like?

What's not so clear to the population at large, is what I believe to be the looming limit of LLMs. What's very clear is these are
already valuable as is and ever more gradual improvements will still be worthwhile tasks. So are they overhyped, yes in their potential,
no in their worth.
